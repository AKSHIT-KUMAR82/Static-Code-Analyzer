We have created this project for our university "Practical Based Learning" (i.e PBL).
In this project, we've developed a static code analyzer majorly focusing on detecting security vulnerabilities and improving code quality. 
It analyze whole C program before executing it and categorize improvements in terms of code quality(eg: Redundancy, Unused variables, Magic numbers etc) 
and security vulnerabilities(eg: Sql injection, Unsafe functions, hardcoded passwords etc)
